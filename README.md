## THUS Utils
This is a collection of assorted utilities. These scripts represent the degree
to which I am willing to write a script than do mundane tasks that I do all the
time. I regularly revise them/clean them up, and I'm working on adding some
basic documentation so I stop forgetting how to use them. So, consider them
buggy until proven innocent, but feel free to use and abuse scripts and
snippets that you find useful.
